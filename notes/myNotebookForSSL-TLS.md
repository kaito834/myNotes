  - 1.2. Protect Private Keys, 1. Private Key and Certificate
    - Restrict access to private Key
    - Generate private key and CSR on trusted computer
    - Protect private key by password in backup system
      - *Private key passwords donâ€™t help much in production because a knowledgeable attacker can always retrieve the keys from process memory*
    - Revoke old certificate and generate new key after compromise
    - Renew certificate every year, always with new private key
