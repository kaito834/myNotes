This is my tutorial for [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/), multi protocol USB security keys developed by Yubico.

# What is YubiKey
Yubikey is a security key device, which is developed by [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/).
Yubikey consists of a few product series, and support [security functions below](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/).
Yubikey users can use Yubikey as 2 factor authentication device, secure key storage and other security purpose.
Also, [a lot of Web service](https://www.yubico.com/solutions/) have already integrated with Yubikey.

- Secure Static Passwords
- Yubico OTP
- OATH – HOTP (Event)
- OATH – TOTP (Time)
- Smart Card (PIV-Compatible)
- OpenPGP
- FIDO U2F (Universal Second Factor)
- Secure Element

# SSH public key authentication by YubiKey
There are 2 ways for SSH public key authentication by YubiKey. The procedures of way 1. are explained in this document.

1. [Use certificate as SSH key stored in YubiKey with PIV](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/)
2. [Use PGP key pair as SSH key stored in YubiKey](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/SSH_authentication/)

## My Environment
- YubiKey 4
- Windows 10 Professional
- `openssl` included in Git for Windows
- [Yubico PIV Tool](https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/)
- [OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki)
- [putty-cac](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases)

## Procedures: Use certificate as SSH key stored in YubiKey
This procedures allow you to log in github.com via SSH public key authentication by YubiKey.

Also, this procedures are based on [dev.yubico: Using PIV for SSH through PKCS11](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/SSH_with_PIV_and_PKCS11.html), and I noted something interesting and issue happened on my work at "Notes for the procedures" section below.

1. Download the latest Yubico PIV Tool and extract it
2. Insert YubiKey into USB slot
  1. Change [PIN/PUK, Management Key(MGM)](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Introduction/Admin_access.html) if you don't change default value of PIN/PUK, MGM  
3. Generate RSA key pair by `openssl` command (Refer to [dev.yubico:Generating keys using OpenSSL](https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/Guides/Generating_keys_using_OpenSSL.html))
  1. NOTE: My YubiKey 4 is vulnerable to [YSA-2017-01/CVE-2017-15361](https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2017-01/), so RSA key pair is generated at out of YubiKey
4. Import RSA private key into YubiKey slot 9a, and then delete the private key from your disk
5. Generate self-signed certificate
6. Import the self-signed certificate into YubiKey
7. Install OpenSC and confirm file path of `opensc-pkcs11.dll`
  1. Default install path: `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\opensc-pkcs11.dll`
8. Download putty-cac and run the putty-cac
9. Configure setting below on putty-cac window
  1. Connection > SSH > Certificate: Click [Set PKCS Cert...] button and select `opensc-pkcs11.dll` at step 7
  2. Select certificate for SSH authentication based on CN value defined at step 5.
  3. Click [Copy to Clipboard] button and add copied SSH public key into your GitHub account (Refer to [GitHub document](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))
  4. Confirm that checkbox:"Attempt certificate authentication" is enabled
10. Input `github.com` at Host name field and click [Open] button
11. Start SSH session, and then input `git` as log in user
12. Open putty authentication dialog and input your PIN code
13. Close SSH session silently if you succeeded to log in
  1. NOTE: GitHub does not provide shell access (Refer to [GitHub document](https://help.github.com/en/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection))
14. Congratulation!

```

### Notes for the Procedures
#### Error: Failed authentication with the application
"Failed authentication with the application" error may happen if you don't run yubico-piv-tool.exe without `-k` option.
You can find explanation about the error in [Yubico PIV Tool Command Line Guide](https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Yubico_PIV_Tool_Command_Line_Guide_en.pdf).

#### Failed CAPI cert approach at putty-cac
putty-cac allows you to authenticate public key stored in YubiKey via Windows native API; Setting of Connection > SSH > Certificate: [Set CAPI Cert...].
However, I didn't succeed the approach on my end, because putty authentication dialog at step 12. didn't open on the approach.
According to [a support thread on yubico](https://forum.yubico.com/viewtopica529.html?p=9865), it supposes that windows driver replaced by Windows Update causes this issue.

Therefore, `opensc-pkcs11.dll` in OpenSC is used in the procedures above as alternative approach.

#### GitHub doesn't allow their user to add vulnerable SSH public key at GitHub
If you try to add vulnerable SSH public key for YSA-2017-01/CVE-2017-15361 at GitHub, the action will be failed with error messages below.
According to [issue 127 on yubico-piv-tool](https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/issues/127), GitHub assumes to detect vulnerable SSH public key and block to add the key at GitHub.
> Key is weak. GitHub recommends using ssh-keygen to generate a RSA key of at least 2048 bits.

By the way, messages below will be outputted if you run `generate` action via yubico-piv-tool at vulnerable YubiKey for YSA-2017-01/CVE-2017-15361.
```
$> yubico-piv-tool.exe -s 9a -A RSA2048 -a generate -o public.pem
YubiKey serial number 5436356 is affected by vulnerability CVE-2017-15361 (ROCA) and should be replaced. On-chip key generation was permitted by default, but is not recommended.  The default behavior will change in a future Yubico release.  See YSA-2017-01 <https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2017-01/> for additional information on device replacement and mitigation assistance.
Successfully generated a new private key.
